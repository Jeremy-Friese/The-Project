# The-Project

Summary: See the Project on my portfolio website: https://scottmbecker.com/

To track real world data analysis results for my training to ride a Century Ride (100 Miles personal goal) and the MS 150 (Houston, Texas supporting muscular dystrophy) in April 2023.

This project is ongoing for the 6 months up to the MS 150. New data and rides are posted weekly, with monthly recaps of the data / rides. Data sets, along with the SQL and Python code are updated monthly and made available here on My Github Page – The Project

To see my rides and the data associated with them, along with videos of my virtual rides, please see the Rides and Data Page.

Please consider DONATING to support muscular dystrophy : MS 150 HOUSTON (You will also help fund my ride. I have set a $500.00 goal.)

I am using Excel, Tableau, Data Studio (Looker), Google and YouTube Analytics for data analysis and visualizations. I am using Google Big Query for SQL analysis. I have created data pipelines in Google Cloud to pull in the data from Google Analytics, Google Ads as well as YouTube Data. I am using Juypter Notebooks for Python. (NOTE – The October data is me getting my feet wet and figuring out the details. There is only data on my vitals from about 10/14/2022, and missing data elements as I added gear and decided on metrics.)

I am using a Garmin Tacx Smart Flow Trainer along with road cycling (Garmin Edge 830) on my Trek Domane AL5 for my workouts and rides. I am also using Strava, Garmin Connect, Google Fit and Samsung Health apps as data sources for analysis.

Metrics include, dates of the rides, ride type, route, distance, average and max speeds, average and max cadence, average and max power, total work (kj), training load and more.

I am also tracking my health vitals daily, including weight, heart rate, blood pressure, BMI, body fat and more to track my overall improvements.

I am posting my rides as well as links to some of the videos of my rides on the Garmin Tacx to YouTube. These are my initial rides to get a baseline, but can also be used by anyone to train with as well. I have added royalty free music to them in order to provide some inspiration.
