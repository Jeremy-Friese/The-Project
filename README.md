# The-Project

Data Analyst Portfolio Project for https://scottmbecker.com/

Summary
To track real world data analysis results for my training to ride a Century Ride (100 Miles personal goal) and the MS 150 (Houston, Texas supporting muscular dystrophy) in April 2023. This project will be ongoing for the 6 months up to the MS 150. New data will be posted weekly, with monthly recaps of the data / rides. Data sets , along with the SQL and Python code will be made available here on My Github

I will use Excel, Tableau, Data Studio (Looker), Google and YouTube Analytics for data analysis and visualizations. I will also use SQL Server and Google Big Query for SQL analysis. I will use Juypter Notebooks for Python.

I am using a Garmin Tacx Smart Flow Trainer along with road cycling (Garmin Edge 830) on my Trek Domane AL5 for my workouts and rides. I will also be using Strava, Garmin Connect, Google Fit and Samsung Health apps as data sources for analysis.

Metrics will include, dates of the rides, ride type, route, distance, average and max speeds, average and max cadence, average and max power, total work (kj), training load and more.

I will also be tracking my health vitals daily, including weight, heart rate, blood pressure, BMI, body fat and more to track my overall improvements.

I will post my rides as well as links to some of the videos of my rides on the Garmin Tacx to YouTube. These will be my initial rides to get a baseline, but can also be used by anyone to train with as well. I have added royalty free music to them in order to provide some inspiration.
