Just seeing how everything uploads here. This is a sample JOIN. Will update when I have more stats. 

BIG Query SQL 

SELECT DISTINCT stats.DATE
,ROUTE
,RIDE_TYPE
,DISTANCE
,AVG_SPEED
,vitals.WEIGHT
,vitals.BMI__

 FROM `portfolio-website-smb.OCT_STATS.oct_stats` as stats
 
 FULL JOIN `portfolio-website-smb.OCT_VITALS.oct_vitals` as vitals

 ON (
vitals.DATE = vitals.DATE

 )
WHERE vitals.DATE < '2022-10-14' AND WEIGHT > 170
ORDER BY DATE
