Just seeing how everything uploads here. This is a sample JOIN. Will update when I have more stats. 

BIG Query SQL 

SELECT DISTINCT vitals.DATE
 ,stats.DATE
 ,TIME
 ,RIDE_TYPE
 ,ROUTE 
 ,DISTANCE
 ,AVG_SPEED
 ,MAX_HR
 ,MAX_CADENCE
 ,WEIGHT
 ,BMI__
 ,SYSTOLIC
 ,DIASTOLIC
FROM `portfolio-website-smb.OCT_STATS.oct_stats` as stats
LEFT JOIN `portfolio-website-smb.OCT_VITALS.oct_vitals` as vitals
ON (
stats.DATE = stats.DATE
)
ORDER BY vitals.DATE
